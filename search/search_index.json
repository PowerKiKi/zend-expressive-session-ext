Installation: Run the following to install this library: $ composer require zendframework/zend-expressive-session-ext Configuration If your application uses the zend-component-installer Composer plugin, your configuration is complete; the shipped Zend\\Expressive\\Session\\Ext\\ConfigProvider registers the Zend\\Expressive\\Session\\Ext\\PhpSessionPersistence service, as well as an alias to it under the name Zend\\Expressive\\Session\\SessionPersistenceInterface . Otherwise, you will need to map Zend\\Expressive\\Session\\SessionPersistenceInterface to Zend\\Expressive\\Session\\Ext\\PhpSessionPersistence in your dependency injection container. Usage In most cases, usage will be via Zend\\Expressive\\Session\\SessionMiddleware , and will not require direct access to the service on your part.
